I am building a Black-Jack_Game as my Alx Africa final project  
I am using Angular frame work for the User interface with Flask frame work for the backend and Postgresql for the database.
I starting building my backend in Pycharm for a long while before migrating to Visual Studio code.
I performed unit testing on my Angular project using Jasmine testing framework called Karma
When starting my Angular project you need to do the following; npm install, ng serve and ng build
For my flask project you create a virtual environment and run Python app.py
Version Control: Git.
